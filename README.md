####Motion Squirt

Name says it all. This little python app is designed to run on a raspberry pi, and runs opencv to detect motion. The coordinates of the moving object are used to aim servos in its general direction. Lastly, when motion is detected it triggers a 12v solenoid to squirt water at the target.
